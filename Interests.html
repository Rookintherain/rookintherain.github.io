    <h2>Nature</h2>
        <body>
            I love nature and the animal kingdom. I love geography, including rocks and gems.<br>
            I enjoy caring for animals such as birds and would love for this to have a bigger role in my life someday.

    <h2>Art</h2>
        <body>
           I am a devoted art student with a great love and interest for all things art.<br>
           I would really like to be employed in animation, where I can design characters, storyboards and help bring creations  to life.<br>

    <h2>Adventures</h2>
        <body>
            I really enjoy going on adventures with my friends to cool places like castles, forests and old ruins.<br>
            I have a passion for vintage, victorian and gothic fashion and aesthetics and these adventures really inspire me.
